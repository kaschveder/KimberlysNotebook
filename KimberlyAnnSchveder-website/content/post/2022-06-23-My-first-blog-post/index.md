**Hello there** - thanks for visiting my website. I will be re-posting my notes from school and personal projects on here, along with talking about my career in statistics. I am currently a masters in statistics newly grad, an instructor at my community college, and a freelance statistician also taking some computer science classes and studying for certification exams in preparation for applying to PhD programs and for applying to jobs where I can apply my knowledge to industry.
